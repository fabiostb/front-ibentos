# Front-end Ibento
Simple Angular CRUD Web Application

## Event management
Ibento = 'Event' in Japanese :p

Angular 12 (Material, Flex-Layout) 

## Setup:
- Install NodeJs (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Config API_URL (if necessary) -> default: http://localhost:8080/api/ibento (voir environment.ts)
```sh
@see (BACK-END API) https://github.com/fabiostb/back-ibentos
``` 
- Run (for dependencies):
```sh
npm install
``` 
- Run (to start the server):
```sh
ng serve
``` 
- Go here:
```sh
http://localhost:4200
```
- Enjoy It!

Improvements (TODOs):
- i18n
- allow to change the time in the datetime picker (app-date-time-picker)
- error handling (user/server validations)
- ...

### Enjoy my DateTimePicker component (Two-way binding) :)
-> app-date-time-picker <-
